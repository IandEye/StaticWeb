                        Better health is central to human happiness and well-being. It also makes an important
                        contribution to economic progress, as healthy populations live longer, are more productive, and
                        save more. In a role as a visually challenged student, it is important that they are both
                        physically and emotionally healthy. You can't do a good job in school, if you don't feel well.
                        Being healthy makes you feel good and allow you to perform more effectively. You can maintain
                        your health by taking care of yourself and avoiding toxic situations. This Project encompasses
                        conducting periodical eye, dental and general health checkups to the visually challenged.
                        Organizing eye surgeries based on the eye checkups and feedback from the ophthalmologists. We
                        also organize eye checkup camps at communities and Govt. schools to prevent eye disease, early
                        detection of eye disease will reduce the visually challenged count. This Project encompasses
